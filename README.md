# Machine_learning_Project
This is the main repository of the ML EECE 5644 final project.

Please follow the step in order given below:

Step 1 : TO run this whole project download data .csv files from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raghavdharwal/amazon-ml-challenge-2025/data .
Step 2 : Run the Feature_EDA_Final.py file by using the downloaded dataset file to extract a new dataset and get EDA of the features.
Step 3 : You will now have a train_features_v2.csv and test_features_v2.csv files saved in your project folder. These are the main dataset files used to train all the machine learning aglorithm.
Step 4 : Now run all models SVR_ML.py, RFR_ML.py, CNNnSVR.py, KNN.py and XGboost.py by using the train_features_v2.csv  as data input file.
